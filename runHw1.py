# runHw1.py
# runHw1 is the "main" interface that lets you execute all the
# walkthroughs and challenges in homework 1. It lists a set of
# functions corresponding to the problems that need to be solved.
#
# Note that this file also serves as the specifications for the functions
# you are asked to implement. In some cases, your submissions will be autograded.
# Thus, it is critical that you adhere to all the specified function signatures.
#
# Before your submission, make sure you can run runHw1('all')
# without any error.
#
# Usage:
# python runHw1.py                     : list all the registered functions
# python runHw1.py 'method name'       : execute a specific test
# python runHw1.py all                 : execute all the registered functions
